/* The site we built was basically a collection of profiles, so
we didn't need comments, or mention to comments anywhere.  Here's
some CSS to take out bloggy things like: Post Author, Date,
how many comments, cateogry.*/

.byline {
  display:none;
}

/*Along with the above, we wanted to hide references to
blog categories on the thumbnail pictures in the home
page 'gallery'.  There was also a white left border that needed
to be removed. These modifications did the trick.@

.photo-overlay-text{
 border-left: 0px !important
}

/*These next two helped format our gravity form.  The first one removed
the word 'file' from under the 'choose file' button on the
file upload field.  The word file seemed redundant here.*/

.ginput_post_image_file{
visibility: hidden
}

/* This provided the right backgound color for the form
and tightened up the whitespace a bit.*/
